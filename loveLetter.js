/* Love Letter is a game with sixteen cards and 1-4 players.
Each player has 1 card in their hand at all times.
On each player's turn they take a card from the face down deck, look at both their cards, and choose one to play.
Play continues until the deck is empty or all but one players are eliminated.
Each card has a different power which effects something about the game, and triggers when it is played.

Love Letter can be divided into three stages, the game, a round of the game, and each player's turn within a round.
There are four main objects in the game: the individual cards, the deck of cards, each player's hand of cards, and each player's 
discard pile.

Alex's suggestion: design each card as a constructer object with inbuilt functions.

The command pattern. */
