// This function checks the interaction between different cards based on their type. 1. If a player calls an action against an opponent who played a Priest on their previous turn, that action is cancelled. 2. If a player draws a Countess when they have either a King or a Prince in their hand, they must discard both cards and are out of the round. 3. If a player is forced to discard the Princess, they are out of the round.
